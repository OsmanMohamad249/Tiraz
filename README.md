Taarez (طِرَاز) - AI Tailoring App (FastAPI + Flutter)

This is the official repository for the "Taarez" application, an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) aiming to revolutionize custom tailoring by using AI for body measurements.

Current Status: Sprint 0 (Boilerplate Setup) is COMPLETE.
The main branch is 100% clean, healthy, and ready for Sprint 1 development to begin.

🏗️ Tech Stack (The Official Stack)

The one and only approved tech stack for this project is:

Backend: FastAPI (Python)

Mobile App: Flutter (Dart)

Database: PostgreSQL

Infrastructure: Docker (via docker-compose)

CI/Quality: GitHub Actions (using ruff & black)

(Note: All legacy use of Node.js, Express, React Native, Flask, or MongoDB has been permanently removed from this project.)

🚀 Quick Start (via Docker)

This project is fully containerized with Docker Compose.

Prerequisites

Docker

Docker Compose

Running (for Local Development)

# 1. Get the latest code from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Build and run all services (backend + database)
# This will also build the Flutter app container if defined
docker-compose up --build -d

# 3. (Optional) Check that services are running
docker-compose ps



Accessing Services

Backend (FastAPI): http://localhost:8000

Health Check Endpoint: http://localhost:8000/health

Database (PostgreSQL): Accessible on port 5432 (for tools like DBeaver)

Stopping Services

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

🧪 Testing & Quality (CI)

We use GitHub Actions to run automated CI checks on every PR targeting main:

ruff: For Python code error linting.

black: To ensure consistent code formatting.
