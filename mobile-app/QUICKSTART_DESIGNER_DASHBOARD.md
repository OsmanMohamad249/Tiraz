# Designer Dashboard - Quick Start Guide

## For Developers

### Testing the Implementation

Since Flutter is not installed in the CI environment, here's how to test locally:

#### 1. Prerequisites
```bash
# Ensure Flutter is installed
flutter --version

# Navigate to mobile app directory
cd mobile-app/

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get
```

#### 2. Run the App
```bash
# Run on connected device or emulator
flutter run

# Or specify a device
flutter run -d chrome  # Web
flutter run -d macos   # macOS
```

#### 3. Test Designer Flow

**Create a Designer User:**
1. Either use existing designer account or register a new user
2. In backend, update user role to 'designer':
   ```sql
   UPDATE users SET role = 'designer' WHERE email = 'test@designer.com';
   ```

**Test Login & Navigation:**
1. Launch app
2. Login with designer credentials
3. ✅ Should navigate to DesignerDashboardScreen (not HomeScreen)

**Test Empty State:**
1. If designer has no designs yet
2. ✅ Should see empty state message with icon
3. ✅ "You haven't added any designs yet. Tap '+' to create your first one!"

**Test Add Design:**
1. Tap FloatingActionButton (+)
2. Fill form:
   - Name: "Royal Blue Thobe"
   - Description: "Elegant traditional thobe with modern styling"
   - Base Price: "350.00"
3. Tap "Save Design"
4. ✅ Should see success SnackBar
5. ✅ Should return to dashboard
6. ✅ New design should appear in list

**Test Validation:**
1. Try submitting with empty fields → ❌ Should show validation errors
2. Try price < 0 → ❌ Should show validation error
3. Try name < 3 chars → ❌ Should show validation error

**Test Customer Flow:**
1. Logout from designer account
2. Login with customer credentials (role = 'customer')
3. ✅ Should navigate to HomeScreen (not DesignerDashboardScreen)

#### 4. Check State Management
1. Add multiple designs
2. Pull down to refresh → ✅ Should reload list
3. Tap refresh button → ✅ Should reload list
4. Close and reopen app → ✅ Should remember role and route correctly

### API Endpoints Used

Make sure backend is running and these endpoints work:

**Authentication:**
```bash
# Login
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -d "username=designer@test.com&password=password123"

# Get current user
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Design Operations:**
```bash
# Get designer's designs
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/designs/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"

# Create design
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/designs/ \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Test Design",
    "description": "Test description",
    "base_price": 350.0
  }'
```

### Environment Configuration

Update `mobile-app/lib/utils/app_config.dart` if needed:
```dart
static String get apiUrl {
  // Point to your backend
  return 'http://localhost:8000';  // Local
  // return 'https://api.taarez.com';  // Production
}
```

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: "Failed to load designs"**
- Check backend is running
- Check API URL in app_config.dart
- Check JWT token is valid
- Check user has designer role

**Issue: "Login successful but goes to wrong screen"**
- Check user role in database
- Check `/users/me` endpoint returns correct role
- Clear app data and login again

**Issue: "Design created but not showing"**
- Check POST /designs/ returns 201
- Check design has correct owner_id
- Try pulling down to refresh
- Check GET /designs/me returns the design

**Issue: "App crashes on login"**
- Check all imports are correct
- Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`
- Check for null safety issues

### Extending the Implementation

**Add Design Detail Screen:**
1. Create `design_detail_screen.dart`
2. Update `DesignListItem.onTap()` to navigate there
3. Pass design object to detail screen

**Add Edit Functionality:**
1. Add edit button in detail screen
2. Create `edit_design_screen.dart` (similar to add)
3. Pre-fill form with existing values
4. Use `DesignService.updateDesign()`

**Add Image Upload:**
1. Add image picker dependency
2. Add image upload to backend
3. Update `AddDesignScreen` with image picker
4. Display image in `DesignListItem`

**Add Delete Functionality:**
1. Add delete button in detail screen
2. Show confirmation dialog
3. Use `DesignService.deleteDesign()`
4. Return to dashboard and refresh

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Designer can login and see Dashboard
- [ ] Customer sees HomeScreen
- [ ] Empty state displays correctly
- [ ] Add design form works
- [ ] Validation catches errors
- [ ] Design created successfully
- [ ] Dashboard refreshes after add
- [ ] List displays designs correctly
- [ ] Price formatted as SAR
- [ ] Logout works
- [ ] App remembers role on restart
- [ ] Error states display correctly
- [ ] Loading states display correctly

### Performance Tips

1. **Large Lists**: If designer has many designs, consider pagination
2. **Images**: When images are added, use `cached_network_image` package
3. **Refresh**: Use `ref.invalidate()` sparingly, consider `ref.refresh()` for manual triggers
4. **State**: Keep FutureProvider for simplicity, move to StateNotifier if more complex state needed

### Security Notes

✅ JWT tokens stored securely via flutter_secure_storage
✅ Role verification done on backend (cannot be bypassed)
✅ No sensitive data exposed in UI
✅ Proper error messages (no stack traces)

### Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check documentation in `DESIGNER_DASHBOARD.md`
2. Check architecture in `ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`
3. Review backend API documentation
4. Check Flutter console for errors
